As an App Buyer, you cannot view or use private apps unless an App Developer shares their private app with you. In this case, the App Developer must send you an invitation that grants you access to the app.

The App Developer sends an invite through their Marketplace account, and Fortellis generates an invitation email to you that includes a **View App Details** button. Click the button to navigate to the app's Details page, where you can click the **Activate** or **Subscribe** button to the initiate the activation process.

You must have a connectCDK account in order to activate an app. During the app-activation process, the web flow guides you through the creation of a new connectCDK account if you don't already have one.

Note that only the users who have been granted access to an app can activate and use the private app. While any user with the URL can view the app's Details page, Fortellis issues an error message if the user tries to activate the app without having been grated permission to activate the app.
