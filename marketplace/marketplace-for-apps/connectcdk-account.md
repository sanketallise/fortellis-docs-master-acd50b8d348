### Signing in with Multi-Factor Authentication

Depending on your connectCDK account, you might be required to authenticate with multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA adds an extra layer of security to your account, but it can also add an extra step when signing in.

If required, set up MFA as instructed and add MFA to your sign-in process.
