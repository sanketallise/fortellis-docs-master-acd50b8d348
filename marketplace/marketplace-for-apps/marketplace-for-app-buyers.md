The Fortellis [Marketplace]($[marketplaceUrl]) is where **App Developers** and **App Buyers** meet.

Apps built with Fortellis APIs offer industry-standard interfaces and authorization flows. Additionally, in order to list an app on Marketplace, the App Developer must pass their app through a review process that ensures the app meets Fortellis guidelines.

For App Buyers, the integration process is similar for all apps listed on Marketplace, and groups of apps can provide different levels of interoperability.

All together, Marketplace gives *App Developers* a solid foundation on which they can build their solutions, and this creates a consistency that *App Buyers* trust as they activate and subscribe to the apps listed on Marketplace.

> **Note:** You must have a connectCDK account before you can activate a Fortellis app.

## APIs and Apps

Generally, APIs and apps serve these different functions:

* Apps provide user interfaces (UIs)
* APIs post and retrieve the information used by apps

Using Marketplace, App Buyers follow this process as they look to improve the solutions they provide:

* **Discover** apps by browsing Marketplace for apps that meet workflow needs
* **Evaluate** apps by their descriptions and details of the APIs they use
* **Activate** apps to use them at the locations of your choice

During the app-activation process, the App Buyer can contact the App Developer for integration support and for other inquiries about app.

## Browsing Apps on Marketplace

Discover apps on Marketplace by *category*, *publisher*, *integration*, or by *keyword search*.

You can page through all the apps listed in [Marketplace]($[marketplaceUrl]) by clicking **Show More Apps** at the bottom of each page of listed apps.

Focus your search using the app filters listed on the left nav of the interface:

* **Discover by**
* **Categories**
* **Publishers**
* **Integrations**

If you know the name of an app, type it into the Marketplace **Search** box to find the app's Details page.

If the app you're searching for is private, the App Developer must share the app with you before you can view and activate it. For details, see [Activating a Private App](/docs/marketplace-for-app-buyers/marketplace-for-apps/activating-private-apps).

## Evaluating Apps

The *Details page* for each app includes documentation, videos, and screen shots that describe the use cases and functionality of the app in a tabbed format.

The Details page also includes information on the APIs used by the app, plus available pricing plan information. Combined, this gives App Buyers the tools needed to fully evaluate an app.

The Details page uses the following *tabs* to describe the different aspects of the app:

* **Overview** and **Highlight** tabs describe app's use cases and capabilities
* **API Integration** lists the APIs used by the app
* **Support** has contact information for the app provider
* **Reviews** posted by app users

In addition to the app's descriptions, the Details page provides:

* The app provider's website, listed under the title of the app
* A **Legal** section, provided by some apps. Found in the left nav bar, this section contains the app's **Terms of Use** and **Privacy Policy**

## Activating Apps

Once you select an app to use, **activate** it. Once it's activated in your portfolio, you can manage the app's connections.

The app activation process requires the App Buyer to agree to the Terms and Conditions and Pricing Plans provided by the App Developer. Depending on the app, these agreements can be made either online through Marketplace flows or offline, via private negotiations with the App Developer.

### Activation Flows

When you select an app, the app's **Details** page contains one of the following buttons at the top of the left nav:

* **Activate** – You must have an existing business relationship with the App Developer before you can directly activate the app.
* **Subscribe** – Marketplace flows provide access to the App Developer's pricing plans and terms of service, allowing you to active the app online.

> When you've discovered an app you want to activate, see [Activating an App](/docs/marketplace/marketplace-for-apps/activating-apps) for the details on configuring and activating apps.

### Contacting the App Developer

If you have questions about an app or its conditions of use, contact the App Developer as follows:

1. Click **Contact Publisher** on the left side of the app's Details page.  
    The **Name** and **Email** fields of your message should autopopulate. If not, sign in to Fortellis and configure your account's email address and name fields.
1. Type your message in the **Add Message** box, then click **Submit** to send your message.

Fortellis forwards your notification to the App Developer, and it emails a confirmation note to your account indicating the message was sent.

## The App Activation Process

When you activate an app, the following process begins:

1. The App Developer reviews and agrees to the App Buyer's activation request
1. The App Developer approves connections to the app
1. As needed, the App Buyer configures the app and APIs used by the app

Note that this process can differ between apps. App Developers can choose to automatically approve your connection requests, or they can choose to review all app activation requests.

## Leaving Reviews for Apps

If you like the apps you use, promote them by giving user feedback. Promoting an app is a good way to expand the audience for the app and help fuel its future growth.

1. Navigate to the app's **Details** page and assign the number of stars equal to your rating. The more stars, the better your review.
1. Enter the title of your review, type your review comments, then click **Submit**.
1. Click **OK** after proof-reading your message.
