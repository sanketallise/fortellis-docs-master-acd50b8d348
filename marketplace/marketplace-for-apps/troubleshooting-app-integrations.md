If you're having trouble getting up and running with an app, follow these escalation paths:

* If you are unable to activate an app, visit the [Community forum]($[communityUrl]) for self-service support, or contact the [Fortellis support team](https://fortellis.io/contact-us).
* If you successfully enabled the app but the registration has not completed or the API Developer has not yet accepted the connection, contact the App Developer.

If you have a problem with the app's performance after the connection has been made:

1. Contact the App Developer to see if they can offer assistance.  
    The App Developer can help troubleshoot problems with the app's UI, but might need to refer you to the API Developer if there issues are with the data services.
1. If the App Developer finds an issue with the API, contact the API Developer with the `Subscription-Id` and the ID of the app you're using.
1. If the API Developer cannot identify the problem with the API, they may choose to contact Fortellis to investigate any problems on the platform; the end user should not be the one contacting Fortellis because they don't have the full details of the issue.

You can also view the [Status Monitor](https://status.fortellis.io/) to see if there are any issues with the platform.

> **Note:** Each team can only help with the issues over which they have control. Remember that an App Developer is unable to remedy an issue if the trouble is in the backend API services.
