When you create an API in an Organization, it is "private" by default and only those in the Organization, or those that you explicitly share the API with, can see and use the API.

In order to list your API in the [API Directory]($[apiReferenceUrl]), you must make the API "public."

## Making an API Public

To convert your API from a private to a public API, do the following:

1. Sign in to Fortellis, then hover over you name and click **Change**.
1. Enable the Organization in which the API was registered.
1. Find and click on the API listing, then complete the following information for the API:
    * **Documentation**
    * **Support**
    * **Pricing**
    * **Terms**
1. Click **Make Public** at the bottom of the page.

> **Note:** You must complete all required fields before you can make your API public.

And that's it! When you make your API public, Fortellis automatically lists it in the API Directory and all the information you entered during the registration process is displayed in the API Directory on the API Detail page.

For more information on what gets listed, see [API Directory Listings](/docs/general/api-developers/api-directory).
