Once you delete an API, app users can no longer connect to the API.
To delete an API, you must remove every instance of the API from every environment.

## Deleting APIs from Environments

1. Sign in to [Fortellis]($[devNetworkUrl]).  
1. To select the organization that the API belongs to, do the following:  
    1. Hover over your name in the upper-right corner.  
    1. Click **Change** to select the organization.  
    1. Select the organization.  
    1. Click **OK** to continue.
1. To select the API, do the following:  
    1. Click **View All** next to APIs.  
    1. Click the API.  
1. Click the environment where you want to delete the API.
1. Click the menu button next to the API.  
1. Click **Delete** to delete the version of the API.
1. Click **OK** to confirm your choice.

Once you have deleted all versions of your API in every environment,
