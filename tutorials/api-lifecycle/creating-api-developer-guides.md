To help App Developers onboard your API, create an *API Developer Guide* that tells users about all the public-facing features of the API, as well as how and when to use them.

In a nutshell, the *API Developer Guide* should describe:

* All the public features supported by the API service, as defined in the associated API specification
* The system dependencies and setup needed in order to use the API
* An outline of the use cases the API addresses
* Examples showing the integration of the outlined use cases

## A Developer Guide Boilerplate

An *API Developer Guide* should advertise the features of the API in addition to covering how to use the features. The easier and faster it is for an App Developer to integrate your API, the happier they will be with your API service.

The following resource provides an outline for an *API Developer Guide*, it includes what an App Developer needs to know to consume a Fortellis API:

* [API Developer Guide Boilerplate]($[docsUrl]/static/images/unbranded-API-DevGuide_Boilerplate-ed6.docx)

The boilerplate is unbranded, copy the Word file and use it as a base for your own guide, or use the boilerplate to see the types of information you might present in your own API Developer Guide. For tips on the Word styles used in the boilerplate, see the companion guide, [Word Styles Guide]($[docsUrl]/static/images/Fortellis-DevDocs-Word-Styles-User-Guide_ed6.pdf).

**Note:** You must save API Developer Guide in PDF format before you can upload it to the API listing in your Developer Account.

## API FAQ Sheets

You can use the following template to create a FAQ for your API:
