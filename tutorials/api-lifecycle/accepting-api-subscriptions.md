If an app that uses your API implements the Admin API, you need to notify Fortellis whenever you accept an API subscription request from an App Buyer so the API Gateway can authorize the buyer's API requests to your API services.

Notify Fortellis by sending a POST request that contains an access token that's generated using your credentials. The access token you send lets internal Fortellis services smoothly integrate apps with your API.

The most secure way to integrate an API with Fortellis is to use the access tokens generated by the Fortellis token server. The alternative is to manually approve incoming subscription requests, or simply have them all automatically approved.

## Validating the Subscription ID

If the the app that uses your API implements the Admin API, accept API subscriptions as described in the [Admin API Overview](/docs/tutorials/admin-api/overview).

If the Admin API isn't being used, you must get the current user's subscription context at runtime, as detailed in [Validating a Subscription-Id Without an Admin API](/docs/tutorials/admin-api/no-admin-api).
