As an App Developer, you can cancel an App Buyer's access to your app if needed.

To cancel an existing app activation:

1. Sign in to your Developer Network account and make sure the Organization containing the app you want to manage is active.
1. Navigate to the **Marketplace** tab, then hover over your name and select **Marketplace Account > Apps**.  
    ![Marketplace Accounts > Apps]($[docsUrl]/static/images/cancel-app-1a.png)  
    The **My Apps** page displays, as shown in the following screen:  
    ![My Apps page]($[docsUrl]/static/images/cancel-app-2a.png)
1. Scroll down to the **In Marketplace** section and locate the app that contains the activation you want to cancel, then click that app listing.  
    The *App Details* page displays.  
    ![App Details page]($[docsUrl]/static/images/cancel-app-3a.png)
1. On the left nav, click the **Activations** menu item to view the app's activation details.  
    ![Subscription Details page]($[docsUrl]/static/images/cancel-app-4a.png)
1. Click on the app activation you want to cancel, then click **Cancel Activation** to cancel the selected subscription.  
    ![Subscription Details page]($[docsUrl]/static/images/cancel-app-5a.png)  
    Before canceling the activation, Fortellis displays a prompt asking you to confirm the subscription cancellation. Click **Yes** to complete the subscription cancellation.

When you cancel a app, Fortellis sends an email like the one below to the App Buyer whose activation you canceled:

An email is also set to the Fortellis administrators to notify them of the app cancellation.

After successfully canceling a app, the total number of activations shown on the **App Details** page is decremented by one from the number of subscriptions the app had before you canceled the app.

> **Note:** A Fortellis Admin may also cancel apps if the dealer goes out of business, if they cannot pay for an API or app, or for other reasons.
