Monetize the apps you create by listing them in [Marketplace]($[marketplaceUrl]). When you list your app in Marketplace, you join the competitive market with other developers who sell apps to Fortellis App Buyers and ISVs.

## The App Listing Process

Before you can list an app, the app must be registered in a Fortellis Organization. For more information, see [Working With Organizations](/docs/general/overview/organizations). The app must also make use of an API before it can be listed in Marketplace.

Listing and selling your app on Marketplace takes the following flow:

* Prepare the information needed to list your app.
* Complete the *App Submission Form*.
* Submit the app for review.
* Publish the app after approval.
* Accept subscriptions.
* Monitor the app's performance.
* Maintain and update the app.

> For details on completing the *App Submission Form*, see [The App Submission Form](docs/tutorials/app-lifecycle/app-submission-form).

## Publishing Your App to Marketplace

After you've completed the *App Submission Form* and the app has been **Approved**, you can publish an app listing on Marketplace.

To publish your app:

1. In [Marketplace]($[marketplaceUrl]), hover over your name and select **Developer Account**.
1. Open the App Details page of of the app you want to publish, then click **Create Listing**.
1. Click **Publish to Marketplace**, then:  
    * Click **Proceed** and sign the **Fortellis App Publishing Agreement**.  
        **Or**  
    * If you are updating the version of an app that has already been published, click **Publish**.  

Fortellis uses One-Click Acceptance to obtain your consent to the Fortellis app-publishing terms. Follow the instructions in One-Click acceptance to agree to the App Publishing terms.

1. Click **Terms** and review the Fortellis app-publishing terms.
1. Click **Accept** at the bottom of the modal to accept the the terms.
1. Click **Submit For Review** at the bottom of the page, then click **Submit** again to confirm your selection.

After submitting your request, email [Fortellis Support](mailto:support@fortellis.io) to request a review of your app.
In your email, include how you want to handle subscriptions:  

* **Allow Subscriptions**
* **Deny Subscriptions**

Fortellis sends an email to your account when the app is submitted. View the app's status for updates.

> **Note:** Unless otherwise configured, Marketplace sets the visibility of the app to public and it sets user-activation to automatic.

### Accepting the Fortellis Terms

Note that you're not prompted to sign the Fortellis *App Publishing Agreement* if you have separately negotiated another contract with Fortellis Administrators. However, you must accept the Fortellis terms for each app listing you publish.

After agreeing to the terms, Fortellis sends your signed terms to the following:

* Fortellis Administrators
* App Developers in your Organization

> **Note:** You must sign the *App Developer Agreement* with Fortellis for each app you plan to publish to Marketplace.
