After submitting the *App Submission Form* to list an app on Marketplace, the app can go through one or more status levels, as outlined in the sections below.

## App Status Levels

A Fortellis Administrator must Approve your app before you can publish it in Marketplace.

### Registered

When you initially create your app in an Organization, the status of the app is set to **Registered**.

### Draft

When you are working on the *App Submission Form* and click **Save**, the status of your app is changed to **Draft**.

### Submitted

The status changes to **Submitted** after you successfully complete the App Submission Form and submit the app for review by the Fortellis Administrator.

### In Review

When a technician at Fortellis opens your app to provision it for Marketplace, the status of the app changes to **In Review**.

### Pending

The activation of an app is set to **Pending** when the activation request is being reviewed by the App Developer.

### Approved

An **Approved* status is awarded to your app after a Fortellis Administrator has completed the review and certified process, indicating your app meets Fortellis standards.

Once your app is Approved, you can it in Marketplace. You get the following benefits with an Approved app:

* You can submit tickets in [Service Connect](/docs/tutorials/app-lifecycle/service-connect).
* The Fortellis Administrator links your Customer Master File (CMF) number to your Service Connect account on your certification phone call.
* You get automatic emails
    when an administrator updates any tickets in Service Connect.  
    **Note:** To request access to Service Connect,
    contact [Fortellis Support](mailto:support@fortellis.io).  
* An Administrator gives you your sign-in information in your launch call.  

### Not Approved

A **Not Approved** status indicates the app does not meet Fortellis standards. Review the notes from the Fortellis Administrator to see the blocking issues. You can resubmit any number of times after making changes.

### Published

After the app has been Approved, you can open it and publish it to Marketplace.

The status of your app changed to **Published** after you've successfully listed your app on Marketplace. App Buyers can now see and activate your app.

While you can update any of the apps you publish with new versions of the app, a Fortellis Admin must review the updates before the app can be re-published.

### Withdrawn

You can *withdraw* an app that is currently published on Marketplace via the **My Apps** page, which you navigate to using the **Marketplace Accounts > Apps** menu option.

From the Marketplace My Apps page, navigate to the **App Details** page for the app you want to manage, then select **Manage Listing Versions** from the left nav menu to display the **Manage Listing Versions** page. From there you can Withdraw a currently Published listing.

### Revoked

The status can change to **Revoked** after it's been published. This can indicate your app has been compromised. Contact a Fortellis Administrator for details.
