When you're completing the **App Submission Form** to list your app on Marketplace, you can select how you want to *activate* the app for new App Buyers.

By default, your app is set to **Auto** activation, where your app is automatically activated for all App Buyers who integrate your app. Also available is **Manual** activation, which requires you, the App Developer, to review and approve new app-activation requests before the app connectivity is activated for the App Buyer.

If you choose **Manual** activation (on the form, under **Settings > Activation**), the following process takes place when an App Buyer selects your app for integration:

1. The App Buyer gets notified that their activation request is getting reviewed by the App Developer.
1. App Developers receive automatic email notifications when a request is pending (unless they opt to manually check for activation requests).

When you receive an activation request, sign in to Developer Network with App Developer privileges, then:

1. Hover over your name and select **Marketplace Account > Subscriptions**.
1. Review and respond to the current activation requests listed on the **App Activation** page.  
    Activation requests are listed individually by the dealerships that requested app connectivity.  
    By default, each request is set to **Pending**.  
    Use the drop-down menu to the right of each activation request to set the **Status** of the request to **Approve** or **Deny**, or do nothing to keep the status set to **Pending**.

1. After configuring each of the activation requests, click **Save** to confirm your selections.

When you update subscription requests, Fortellis emails the App Buyer notifying them that their app status has changed.

With manually-activated apps, the App Buyer can configure and begin using the app as soon as App Developer approves the activation request.

App Buyers must contact the App Developer to negotiate any rejected subscription requests.
