Fortellis provides developers with several ways to get support when they run into issues.

## API Documentation

Documentation for APIs can include the following publications:

* *API Developer Guide*, an implementation guide that provides details on how to use the API.
* *API Spec*, an OpenAPI specification that acts as the contract between the API Developer and the App Developer. The specification defines in entirety the services the API interfaces support.
* *Postman collection*, a collection of calls that you can run with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), a third-party developer tool.  
    During API development, API Developers can attach collections to their APIs, giving an aid to the other developers in their Fortellis Organization who want to use the API.
* Other guides, images, tools or references provided by the API Developer.

Each API should include product documentation that provides all the details needed to evaluate and use the API. It is the API Developer's task to provide all the necessary tools and information needed to use their API product.

## Community Support

On Developer Network, the [Community]($[communityUrl]) tab hosts a platform where you can get support from the Fortellis developer community.

Review the FAQs and see if your questions have been answered in previous posts, or submit questions to see if others have had similar experiences. Also, you can become a good netizen and pay it forward by answering the questions posted by other Fortellis developers.

## API Support

API's published in the API Directory must include information on how the API Developer supports their API, including:

* The phone number of the API Developer
* A link to the API support page
* A link to the API terms of service, created by the API Developer
* Additional terms from App Developers who integrate the API
* A link to the API's support page

### Emailing the API Support Team

On the **Support** tab of the API's Home page:

1. Click **Contact Support** and enter your **Message** in the resulting input box.
1. Click **Submit** at the bottom of the form.

When you send a support message via your browser, Fortellis returns an email to your account confirming your support request.
