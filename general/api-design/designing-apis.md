There are many ways to design and implement APIs. The topics in this section offer a fundamental overview, with some details, of API design.

To start making specs for the automotive industry, we recommend you begin with a review of the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). This is the model upon which all Fortellis APIs are based.

In addition, consult these guides for more information on developing REST APIs:

## Toolkits and SDKs for Building APIs

Developers can use the following tools to send requests and receive responses from an API:

* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
* [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/)
* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)

To create a mock service to produce the response, API Developers can use the following tools:

* [JSON Stub](http://jsonstub.com/) (Recommended)
* [Mockable](https://www.mockable.io/)(Recommended)
* [Httpbin.org](http://httpbin.org/) (Recommended)
* [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
* [IBM Cloud API Management](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/management)
* [Talend](https://www.talend.com/products/application-integration/cloud-api-services/)
* [APImetrics](https://apimetrics.io/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItO_a9qfi4gIVh4rICh1CvwlQEAAYAiAAEgL2yvD_BwE)
