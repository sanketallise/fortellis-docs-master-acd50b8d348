If you plan to monetize your APIs or apps, list them on the Fortellis **API Directory** or **Marketplace** to target your biggest audience, the developers and solution providers looking to create state-of-the-art software for the dealership vertical.

The [API Directory]($[apiReferenceUrl]) and [Marketplace]($[marketplaceUrl]) both have the flexibility for you to create explosive listings for your public-facing APIs and apps.

As a contributor to the Fortellis environment, we wants you to succeed and we can help to promote your published APIs and apps to the following audiences:

* Third-party Developers
* Original Equipment Manufacturers
* Dealers

Below, we outline the ways you can promote and market your API and App listings, and we look forward to collaborating with you to bring your APIs and apps to market.

## Promoting Your Listings

Once your app or API has been approved and published on Fortellis, you can promote your listings using the tools offered by Fortellis.

As outlined below, we provide several co-marketing platforms that give you ways to promote your APIs and apps and we're happy to offer guidance on how to your visibility to your most important customers.

### Blog Posts

The Fortellis Community tab offers a live blog where Fortellis can work with you to create effective announcements about new features and functionality you are offering.

Whether your Go-to-Market staff writes the entire piece blog, or Fortellis helps you co-write the piece, both parties must agree to the final language used in the copy. And always, the by-line for the blog post is your team member of choice.

### Tech Connect Newsletter

When you roll out a new API or app, it can be featured in our monthly newsletter, and you can offer full details of your product with a link to the related blog post.

### Social Media

Fortellis can create social media posts featuring your new API or App. While these posts can be co-written with Fortellis, or by your Go-to-Market staff, both parties must agree to the language used on the Fortellis accounts.

### Fortellis InVents

InVents are live broadcasts based on a theme that promotes new offerings for dealers or developers.

To propose an InVent for your app or API offering, email us at [Fortellis.GTM@cdk.com](mailto:Fortellis.GTM@cdk.com).

Note that Fortellis does not automatically feature new APIs or apps with an InVent event. Submit an outline for your InVent and we will review it to determine viability.

## Published Promotions

Fortellis offers several types of publishing mechanisms that you can use to promote your Fortellis APIs and apps.

### Press Releases

Your team can use our template to draft a press release about your APIs or apps. Note that all press releases must be approved by the Fortellis Go-to-Market team if the Fortellis name or branding is used.

### Fortellis Branding
