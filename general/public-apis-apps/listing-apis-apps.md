To expose their APIs to App Developers, API Developers list their APIs in the **API Directory**. In turn, App Developers (who use the APIs in their apps) market their apps by listing them in **Marketplace**.

When an App Buyer activates an app, the App Developer manages the activation to their app (either automatic or manual) and the API Developers manage the connections made to their APIs through the associated app.

## Private Pricing

API and App Developers create private pricing plans for several reasons:

* To provide preferred pricing to select App Buyers
* To negotiate pricing on a per-buyer basis
* To accommodate App Buyers with special use cases

Private pricing plans can be negotiated as follows:

* API Developers can create private pricing plans for App Buyers when they update their API implementations.  
    * For more, see [Managing APIs](/docs/tutorials/api-lifecycle/updating-apis/#entering-your-pricing-information).
* App Buyers and App Developers can request private pricing plans from API Developers.  
    * For more, see [Activating to Apps](/docs/marketplace/marketplace-for-apps/activating-apps).

## API and App Security

Both APIs and apps must provide the following customer security measures:

* Allow the consumer to “opt out” of having their data sold
* Provide a list of personal identifiable information (PII) collected about the consumer
* Explain why PII data is collected
* Upon request, remove the consumer’s PII data from the dealership’s database
