When you create a new API or app, it is made "private" by default, and the only users who can view the developer project are the ones who are members of the Organization where the project is registered.

To share a private API or app with a larger audience:

* Add more members to the Organization in which the API or app resides
* Share the API or app with members outside the Organization
* Turn the API or app into a "public" API or app

Once public, you can market the API or app using the API Directory or Marketplace, as appropriate.

## Viewing Private APIs and Apps

When signed in to Developer Network, you can view private APIs and apps on an Organization's **Developer Account** page.

The APIs and apps listed on the **Developer Account** page include the private APIs and apps registered in the currently active Organization, plus any of the developer projects you've been granted permission to view.

## Advantages of Private APIs and Apps

Among the many things you can do using private APIs and apps are the following:

* Collaborate on an API or app with a tightly-controlled team while it's being developed
* Share the private API or app with other Organizations
* Offer exclusive usage to third-party individuals or contracted developers

Open a small API or app up to larger audiences by expanding the membership of the Organization to those who share your email domain, or by sharing the developer project with users from outside your domain.

To publicly release your API or app as a General Release (GR) product, move the API or app from private to public.

## Benefits of Keeping APIs and Apps Private

While many apps get publicly released, there are several reasons to keep an API or app private. With a private API or app, you can:

* Protect exclusive partnerships
* Provide more responsive support
* Protect proprietary data and PII exposed by an API Spec
* Protect innovation in the automotive space

## Creating Public APIs and Apps

Changing an API or app from private to public has the following effect, depending on whether you're updating an API or app, as follows:

* **Public APIs** get listed on [API Directory]($[apiReferenceUrl])
* **Public Apps** get listed on [Marketplace]($[marketplaceUrl])

Once listed, the API or app is public-facing, any Fortellis users who have access to the venues will be able to view the API or app listing.

* [Listing Apps](/docs/tutorials/app-lifecycle/listing-apps)

Before creating an API service, consider who should have access to the API or app while it's being developed versus who should have access to it in the long run. If you intend to share the service with an unrestricted audience, plan in advance for making it public and how you are going to roll out the release.
