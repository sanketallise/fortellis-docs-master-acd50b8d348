You can customize your Developer Network account settings as follows:

1. Sign in to your account, then hover over your name and click **Settings**.
1. Choose one of the following options:
    * **Personal Information** — Your email and other account information
    * **Password** — Your account password
    * **Security** — Security settings, such as two-factor authorization (2FA)

## Changing Your Personal Information

The personal information in your Developer Network account includes the account email address plus the name and phone number associated with the account.

Choose the **Personal Information** tab in the **Settings** dialog, then:

1. Click any field holding personal information for your account.
1. Update the information in that field.
1. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

## Changing Your Password

Choose the **Password** tab in the **Settings** dialog, then:

1. Enter your current password.
1. Follow the password requirements as enter your new password.
1. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

## Two Factor authorization

Two factor authorization protects you from the following:

* Brute-force attacks where someone attempts to enter your username and common password combination to try to guess your password
* Someone that already has your Fortellis password, but does not have access to your second authorization factor

Choose the **Security** tab from the **Settings** dialog, then:

1. Click **Turn On**.
1. Enter your **Mobile Phone** number.
1. Click **Next**.
1. Enter the verification code sent by text to the phone number you entered.  
    **Note:** You can also **Request a new code** or **Cancel**.
1. Click **Verify**.

### Signing in with Two-Factor Authorization

If you have 2FA enabled when you sign-in to the Developer Network, Fortellis:

1. Prompts you to choose a 2FA method of contact:
    * The email address of your Fortellis account
    * The phone number of your Fortellis account
1. Click **Send Verification Code**.
1. Enter the **Verification Code** that you receive.
1. Select whether you want Fortellis to use the selected 2FA method as the default.
1. Click **Submit**.
