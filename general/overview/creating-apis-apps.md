Developers create APIs and Apps on the Fortellis platform so they can share their developer projects with other Fortellis members.

Navigate to an Organization's **Developer Account** page to view all the APIs and apps associated with the Organization. This is also the page where you create an manage your Fortellis APIs and apps.

To view an Organization's **Developer Account** page:

* Hover over your name in Developer Network, then click **Developer Account** from the resulting context menu.

## APIs and Apps

Create new APIs and apps on the Developer Account page of an Organization. In general:

* Apps provide the interface
* APIs handle the information and data

In many ways, Fortellis handles APIs and app in a similar fashion. However, APIs and apps have different life cycles and Fortellis provides the appropriate support for each development process.

## Creating a New API or App

First, change to the Organization where you want to register your app or API:

1. Sign in to your [Developer Network Account]($[devNetworkUrl]), then hover over your name and click **Change**.
1. Select the Organization you want to activate, then click **OK**.  
    The selected organization is activated and your actions are now associated with that Organization.

Next, create a new API or app by following the prompts in the UI:

1. Click **New API** or **New App** as appropriate.  
    ![Checkbox for Organizations]($[docsUrl]/static/images/registeringANewSolution.PNG)
1. Use the following flows depending on whether you're creating and API or app:  
    * [Registering APIs](/docs/tutorials/api-lifecycle/registering-apis)
    * [Registering Apps](/docs/tutorials/app-lifecycle/registering-apps)
