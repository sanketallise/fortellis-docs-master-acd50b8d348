Fortellis supports the following browsers[^1]:

* Internet Explorer (11 only)
* Google Chrome (88.0.4324.150)
* Firefox (68.12.0esr)
* Safari (14.0.3)

> Fortellis now supports Internet Explorer 11, giving dealers with limited browser access a common way to sign in and manage their Developer Network and Marketplace accounts. Note that Fortellis issues an error if you attempt to access the platform with a version of Internet Explorer older than version 11.

[^1]: Fortellis may function on browser versions older than those noted here; however, we test only against the most recent versions of the listed browsers and we cannot verify the functionality of the platform with older browser versions.
