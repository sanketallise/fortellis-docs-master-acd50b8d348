The **Fortellis Developer Network** provides API Developers and App Developers with a platform to build and market APIs and apps for the dealership vertical. In turn, dealership service providers integrate the Fortellis apps into the solutions they offer to dealerships, OEMs, and others.

Fortellis is growing network of global innovators who are connecting and collaborating to build, test, and publish the next-generation APIs and apps.

## Joining the Developer Network

Joining the Developer Network opens the door for you to:

* Create an API Specification for a Fortellis API
* Develop and test your API service
* Market the APIs you implement
* Create apps using Fortellis APIs
* Market your apps

To join the Developer Network:

1. Navigate to the Developer Network [Sign In]($[devNetworkUrl]) page and click the **Sign Up** button.  
    The **Welcome to Fortellis** screen displays.
1. Complete the new-account form by entering your name and other sign-up information.
    > **Note:** Fortellis provides functionality based on the domain of your account's email address.
1. Check the boxes to accept the Terms and Conditions and to indicate you're not a robot, then click **Create Account**.  
    To verify the account, Fortellis sends an email to the account's email address.

Once verified, you can sign-in to Developer Network using the combination of your email address and password. Fortellis creates a unique ID for your new account and this ID lets you access the APIs and apps tied to your account.

### Organization Enrollment for New Accounts

When you first sign-in to a new Developer Network account, Fortellis gives you the option to join any *Fortellis Organizations* whose domain matches the domain of your account email address.

At your first sign in, Fortellis displays a list of any matching Organizations. For each:

1. Check **Request Access** box next to each Organization you're interested in joining.
