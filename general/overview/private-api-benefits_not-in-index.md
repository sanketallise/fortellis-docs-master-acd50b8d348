Not Ready for Publication! Do not publish as-is.

* Private APIs may keep backend systems more secure.
* Private APIs may keep proprietary information from the wrong people.
* Private APIs may reduce the time and resources to integrate internal IT systems.
* Providers may have custom business logic that is not designed for external parties.
* API Developers may need an API to use internally,
    but the provider may also lack the infrastructure or resources to host the API on an internal system.
* Providers may increase internal development productivity to streamline business operations.
* APIs may need to be discovered on internal applications.
* API Developers may need to meter and limit access to the APIs based on enterprise needs and access rights.
* API Developers may not want to use tokens or another authorization method to access the APIs.
* API Developers may need to consume the API with a large number of requests,
    and they cannot slow down the API with the risk of external users.
* API Developers may want to work directly with consumers to modify how consumers access the API to fit the consumers' needs.
* The API Developer must tell the App Developer about the API and share it.
* Other API Developers do not know about the endpoint and the URL the provider implements.

With a private API, organizations can offer their services to users on an as-needed basis.

Food for thought:

* Present designs for new apps using an API
* Drive collaborative efforts between API implementations and apps
* Become the only provider of an API and the only person that can create apps around that API
* Share the API with only internal parties that need to use the API
* Protect proprietary backend information within the organization
* Use the API to communicate between internal systems that need access to the information
* Collect information on how customers are going to use the API and make improvements before making it public
    * Private APIs require direct contact and conversation between the API Developer and the App Developer
* Reduce the time needed to integrate internal IT systems
* Enable internal developers to leverage existing systems to create new applications
* Limit the number of developers working with the API to focus on features that will most benefit an organization
* Ensure that clients' applications maintain an approved look and feel to guarantee branding and other requirements are met
* Protect custom business logic from changes that third parties may ask for or require
* Reduce the time to market
    * Organizations can rapidly develop and deploy APIs if they can modify them while they are building external applications
* Modernize internal systems before taking APIs public
* Increase internal productivity by 20%-25% with improved collaboration and communication
* Uncouple backend and frontend development to reduce time to develop
* Ensure reliability and functionality through the use of modular internal APIs
* Monitor individual services and measure the lag of different parts of the system
