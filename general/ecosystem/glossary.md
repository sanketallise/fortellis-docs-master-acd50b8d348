| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| API | An API is the combination of the API Spec and the service implementation that the API Developer creates. |
| API Developer | The API Developer creates an API Spec and implements the specification as a service. |
| App Activation | The process that activates an app for an Organization. When the app activation request is approved, the customer is able to manage app connections. |
| API Connection | An API connection links the App Buyer to the API via the app. |
| API Spec | An API specification explains how the API functions and what results to expect when using the API. Fortellis uses the API description language OpenAPI Specification which is designed to be both machine and human readable. |
| App | An app is a unique offering, service or tool that leverages multiple APIs and custom business logic to create a product. It is made available through Exchange Marketplace so that it can be consumed by dealers, OEMs, and ISVs to enhance their business workflows and services. |
| App Developer | Someone who builds apps on the Fortellis platform using Fortellis APIs. In the docs, the API Developer persona wears many hats, as they imagine, develop, implement, list, sell, and maintain their APIs. API Developers monetize their APIs by listing them in the API Directory. |
| App Buyer | A consumer of the apps listed on Marketplace. In the docs, the App Buyer persona can wear many hats, including dealerships, ISVs, OEMs, and other app users. |
| Dealer / Dealership | A dealership is a business that sells new or used vehicles at the retail level based on a dealership contract with an automaker or its sales subsidiary. It employs automobile salespeople to sell their vehicles. |
| Dealer Management System (DMS) | A software suite that provides the tools auto dealers need to more effectively run their business. By bringing together the many parts of a dealership on a single interface, DMS platforms allow business owners to monitor dealership operations more efficiently and see the big picture more clearly. |
| Developer Network | This is the site that API and App Developers use to collaborate on and list their products to the API Directory and Marketplace. |
| ISV (Independent Software Vendor) | An independent software vendor (ISV) is an organization specializing in making and selling software, as opposed to hardware, designed for mass or niche markets. |
| Marketplace | Marketplace is a portal that is part of the Exchange ecosystem where producers and consumers can collaborate, create, and sell apps. For example, ISVs can build and publish an offering for Dealers to use, and OEMs can build and publish an offering targeting their dealer group dealerships. |
| OEM | When referring to automobile manufacturing, OEM is an abbreviation for original equipment manufacturer, that is, the manufacturer of the parts assembled and installed during the construction of a new vehicle. An OEM can also refer to a company that produces parts and equipment that may be marketed by another manufacturer. For example, if Manufacturing Co. A makes car batteries that are used on Company B automobiles, Manufacturing Co. A is an OEM. |
| Organization | There are various types of Organizations that exist on the Fortellis platform. An independent software vendor (ISV), a dealership, or group of dealers can each be considered an Organization. A company can have a single Organization or it can have multiple child Organizations. Prior to publishing anything on Fortellis, registered Fortellis user accounts must be linked to an Organization. |
| SDK (Software Development Kit) | A collection of development tools used to create offerings for automotive commerce written in a specific programming language. An SDK is a way to jump start the creation of offerings that leverage APIs. |
| Services | Groupings of endpoints in an API. A service can also refer to a set of functionalities (such as the retrieval of specified information or the execution of a set of operations) that an API consumer can reuse for different purposes together with policies that should control its usage. |
| Software Ecosystem | A set of businesses functioning as a unit and interacting with a shared market for software and services, together with relationships among them. |
