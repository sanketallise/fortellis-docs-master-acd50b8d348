App Developers use the following methods to search for new APIs to use with their apps:

* Search for public APIs in the API Directory
* Search for API implementations in an Organization
* Find the private APIs to which they have been given access

## Viewing APIs in the API Directory

The [API Directory]($[apiReferenceUrl]) lists all publicly available APIs. Browse the API Directory, then sign in to Developer Network to create an app that uses the API.

For more, see [API Directory Listings](/docs/general/api-developers/api-directory).

## Searching for APIs in the API Directory

You can use the search box at the top right of the page to search for the API if you know the name of it.

## Filtering REST APIs and Async APIs

You can choose four options to view APIs:

* You can view all APIs with both pills selected.
    **Note:** You see this by default.
* You can view all Async APIs with only the **Async API** pill selected.
* You can view all REST APIs with only the **REST API** pill selected.
* You can select no option, but you see all APIs.

## Filtering APIs by Category

API Developers use tags in the specs to categorize their APIs.
You can select the category to only see APIs in that category.

## Viewing APIs Available in your Organization

The Developer Account page lists all private APIs in the active Organization.

1. Sign in to [Developer Network]($[devNetworkUrl]), then hover over your name and click **Developer Account**.
1. Click **View All** to see all your APIs.
1. Click an API listing to see the Details page for the API, which contains the API spec and more.

## Viewing Private Specs in the API Directory

You can view a private API in the API Directory if you have been granted access to the API. If you have access, navigate to the Details page of the API using either it's URL (shared by the owner), or by searching for the API by name in the API Directory:

1. Go to the [API Directory]($[apiReferenceUrl]) and sign in to your account.
1. Enter the name of the API spec in the Search box.  
    You can select to see the following APIs:  
    * **All APIs**
    * **REST APIs**
    * **Async APIs**  
1. Click **All APIs** to show you a list of all the available APIs.
