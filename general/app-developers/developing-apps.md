A Fortellis **App Developer** creates apps that make use of Fortellis APIs. In turn, ISVs and other service providers combine apps to create complete solutions for the dealership vertical.

When an app is market ready, the App Developer can list it in *Fortellis Marketplace*, the location where App Buyers review and activate Fortellis Apps.

The pros of creating a Fortellis app include:

* A common and standardized authorization method used with all APIs
* A common and trusted way to contact Fortellis API Developers
* A common API host and versioning system

## Creating a New Application

The privacy options for an app are similar to those of an API, with the following considerations:

* Anyone in the Marketplace can see and activate a public app
* You can share a Private app in an Organization with select customers

## Target Audiences

By default, apps are private when they are created in an Organization. You can initially register your app in an Organization that has a small membership, allowing you to tightly control access to the app during development. Later, you can grow the organization or you can move the app to a new, larger Organization as needed.

By creating apps in an Organization, App Developers can:

* Control who can see and use the app, enabling the creation of custom apps for an Organization
* Share the app with Fortellis members outside the app's Organization
* Make the app public, enabling the monetization of an app via Marketplace
* Receive activation reports from developer accounts and from Marketplace

## Distributing Apps on Marketplace

When an App Developer completes their testing, they can create a *General Release* of the app by making it "public" and releasing it on Marketplace.

App Buyers can then view app listings on Marketplace to:

* Review app details
* Contact App Developers
* Compare apps
* Activate apps
* Rate apps
